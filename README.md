Optimizing Warehouses &amp; Inventory

This project is designed to optimize inventory management by efficiently scheduling deliveries, managing demand, and minimizing risks. It utilizes data-driven forecasting for dynamic inventory allocation, reduces holding and transportation costs, and optimizes delivery routes. By implementing **PuLP MILP** for cost minimization and **Prophet** for demand forecasting, it ensures timely fulfillment and risk mitigation across the supply chain, enabling data-driven decisions for more efficient inventory management.
